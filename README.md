Creating a Customer Persona as the weekly assignment

My Brand: SafetyNet

Alisson Alone is a woman that lives alone in a big city. She recently had a health scare, that would have gone so much better if she had a person to assist with mobility, or simply calling an ambulance or an emergency contact that could help with medical history.
She passed out at home, and when she woke up, she was weak, but managed to take some medicine, rest and then go to the nearest hospital to check if everything was ok.
Because of this episode, she wondered if a neighbour could be helping her in a moment of distress if they knew she was in danger. She then started to be more friendly towards the people at her building, wishing she could approach someone at some point to be her local medical contact.
While very unsuccessful, she has a point. People that live alone tend to be more closed to themselves. She might need a little help from tech to move forward with that plan.

The problem domain we aim to solve is to connect strangers that are willing to help people around them, while being helped as well by the same community. The creation of an app for mobile and wearables.
As a company, we want to sign up as many people as possible in the micro environment they live, so the network starts to build up.
Following up, we want to sell the software to be incorporated at buildin management companies, where we can advertise the app and their building can be know as a safe haven to people that live alone or don't have a robust support network.

Features in the app:
Emergency question: Are you in distress?
Then a big red button that would connect her to the nearest person (that opted in)
At the sign up, the basic information required would be:

1. Gate code/door code/key location
2. Emergency contact phone number
3. List of medicines you take/health issues you have
4. List of hospitals you can go
   Worth mention: Only the person assisting you would have access to this information, while helping.

My reflection on this:
Based on my brother's experience a few months ago, I had this idea to build up something he could share with his neigbours. He was too weak to make fast decisions, and even if he was ok-ish, would have helped a LOT to have someone.
I started this at the taster session, and was quite pleased with the MVP I have now, given that I learned a little bit more now.
Once you can actually put yourself in the shoes of the persona, the exercise becomes quite easy to do, so I really enjoyed this one.
